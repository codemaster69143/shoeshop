          <h3>Nike Lebron XXI</h3>
          <h3>Php10,895.00</h3>
          <p class="descriptions">Last time around, LeBron flipped the script on his shoe game as only the King can. The encore is even better. The LeBron XXI has a cabling system that works with Air Zoom cushioning and a light, low-to-the-ground design, giving you agile fluidity and speed without excess weight. Created for your ascent and the next generation of hoopers, it's ideal for 'Bron-like open-floor attacks on the hoop and rising towards the rim when the game's pace turns up. This special design highlights the aragonite, which provides support to the mother of pearl and a warm pop of colour. With its extra-durable rubber outsole, this version gives you traction for outdoor courts.</p>
